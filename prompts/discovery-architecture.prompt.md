You are a senior engineering agent. Produce an architecture overview for this repo.

Inputs:
- Read `tasksgodzilla/DISCOVERY.md` and `tasksgodzilla/DISCOVERY_SUMMARY.json` if present.

Deliverable:
- `tasksgodzilla/ARCHITECTURE.md`: high-level system/flow overview (components, data/control flow, runtime/infrastructure, storage/messaging, auth/security, deployment notes).

Rules:
- Work from repo root.
- Do not modify other discovery files in this pass.
- Prefer accuracy over completeness; add TODOs if uncertain.

Checklist:
1) Describe core components/modules and responsibilities.
2) Describe primary user/runtime flows and data/control paths.
3) Describe runtime assumptions, storage/messaging, auth/security, deployment.
