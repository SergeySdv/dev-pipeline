You are an engineering agent running headless in an isolated git worktree (CWD is the worktree root). Your job is to generate *protocol artifacts* for DevGodzilla.

Inputs (already decided; do not ask):
- Protocol name: {{PROTOCOL_NAME}}
- Protocol description: {{PROTOCOL_DESCRIPTION}}
- Step count: {{STEP_COUNT}}

Deliverables (create files; do not rely on terminal output):
- Create the directory `.protocols/{{PROTOCOL_NAME}}/`.
- Write `.protocols/{{PROTOCOL_NAME}}/plan.md` (high-level plan).
- Write step files matching `step-XX-*.md` inside `.protocols/{{PROTOCOL_NAME}}/`:
  - `step-01-setup.md`
  - `step-02-implement.md`
  - `step-03-verify.md` (if STEP_COUNT >= 3)
  - If STEP_COUNT > 3, add more steps as needed with the same naming scheme.

Rules:
- Do NOT run git commands.
- Do NOT create PRs, push branches, or modify remote state.
- Do NOT modify code outside `.protocols/{{PROTOCOL_NAME}}/` in this generation step.
- Keep the plan concrete and repo-aware: refer to real files/paths you see.

Content requirements:
- `plan.md` must briefly summarize the goal and link to each `step-*.md`.
- Each step file must include a short goal and a checklist of concrete sub-tasks.

Now generate the protocol artifacts.
